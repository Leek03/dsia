I've tried clicking this element by xpath,classname, link text and css selector but for all it comes up as unable to locate element. Also the automated chrome tab appears to go into a limbo and goes into a complete blank screen on opening the link. Could someone please help me out, any help is deeply appreciated.

      "This is a brute-force recursive backtracking algorithm. (You can do asymptotically better with some kind of DP thing, or DFS of the assignment-state graph, but this should give a correct answer -- and in interviews it's usually best to get something naive working before trying to get a more optimal solution.)\n",

You could find the solution for the normal maximal bipartite matching, where each kid node is attached to one camp node and vice versa. Then remove the matched kids and redo the maximal bipartite matching - do this for each possible initial solution. Repeat until you hit the occupancy limit of the camp - so 3 iterations if there are 3 spots. Of the resulting solutions, choose the one with the least left out kids and the most even distribution of kids per camp. If this approach works, you could do the follow-up by also removing camp nodes which have reached their individual occupancy limits.\n",

If you need pretty things for your boss, it might be a better option.\n",
