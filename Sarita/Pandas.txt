when the datasets are not of the same type, like some are strings and some are floats. Numpy is useful only when the types are same. 
pandas can handle large datasets
it is a high level data manipulation tool
Built on numpy
In pandas the tabular DataFrame is stored in dataframe
We can build the DataFrame in different ways:
    1. Manually, using dictionaries, here keys are the columns labels and values are the corresponding columns 
        it requires to first import  Pandas as pd
        create a dataframe from dictionary, brics=pd.DataFrame(dict)
        thus a dictionary can be converted to df
    to access index we use brics.index=[], 
    2. csv (comma separated values)
